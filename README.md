  <h3>WELCOME :)</h3>
  <p>My name is Gabriel and I'm a Web3 developer!</p>

## ‚ú® Me Nowadays
I'm a self-taught 18 years old guy who learns fast, is a perfectionist, actually develops smart contracts, is a software engineering student, and a person who explores this giant programming universe.
I have a lot of formed opinions about which tools and technologies to use in different cases. So, contact me if you want to talk about something.

## üéä How I Started
I started copying and editing some Transformice Private Server source-codes made in Python 2.7. I had no programming knowledgement, and was 11 years old, but know how to change some strings! *"haha"*
Some time later, I've decided to start learning programming seriously. Then, I searched free Python courses on YouTube and understood what the codes I was editing is doing.

The next years, I drove into web development. Learnt front-end languages and technologies. Learnt PHP and others technologies I no longer use more. Was a fun time!

## üë∑ Working On
I'm currently doing some Web3 projects with [DarksideDAO](https://github.com/darkside-dao), which I'm a Co-Founder and Solidity Developer, and some freelancing projects. My job is basically write smart contracts, write and execute tests for these contracts, research gas optimization methods, propose ideas and do proof-of-work, explore new protocols and solutions for Web3 projects, and help Web2 applications become Web3 dapps.

Also, I'm open to work!

## üìö Learning Methods
Since I've started learning new technologies and languages, I use this method:
- Search for courses and write down which topics they teach you;
- Do your own searches of these topics and write down;
- Search for code snippets and projects on GitHub;
- Read the source-code of libraries and projects;
- Always read the documentation or wiki of the library;
- Stay in contact with people who use or are learning these technologies;
- Search first, ask later.

## üî≠ Technologies
I can split my knowledgement into these groups:
### I'm comfortable using
- **Elixir** (programming language);
- **Solidity** (programming language);
- **HardHat, Foundry** (ethereum development environment);
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (Node.js).

### I have some knowledgement, but can improve
- **Go** (programming language);
- **Rust** (programming language);
- **Python** (programming language);
- **C/C++** (programming language);
- **HTML, CSS, JS** (front-end technologies);
- **React, Vue, Svelte** (front-end frameworks);
- **Phoenix, Express, Ember.js** (back-end frameworks);
- **MUI, Bootstrap, Tailwind** (CSS frameworks);
- **GCP, AWS, Azure** (cloud platforms).

### I can learn if needed
- Anything!
